# SlammaGram
This is Slamagram, a instagram clone that I made for my final project. This site has no authentication so please be careful using personal information! While using the app you can manage your way around using the navbar at the top. If you would like to create a new post go to the post/new path and fill out the form. When filling out the form to create a new post, you can link the image you would like to use. Please do not delete other posts that you did not create and keep it clean.

# Installation
